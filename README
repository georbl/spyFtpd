spyFtpD (simple python Ftp Daemon)  is a very simple command line interface for
the python library pyftpdlib which provides the functionality to start a FTP
server (http://code.google.com/p/pyftpdlib/).

spyFtpD emphasizes on easy handling in order to start and stop an FTP server 
without any configuration work.

Security issues are not in the main focus of the program. 
There exist a bunch of better solutions out there in case you want to
set up a stable and secure FTP server with good performance.
